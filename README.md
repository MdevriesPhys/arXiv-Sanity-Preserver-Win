# arXiv-Sanity-Preserver-Win
Derived directly from [arXiv Sanity Preserver](http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/), developed by karpathy and others ([git](https://github.com/karpathy/arxiv-sanity-preserver)). While this tool has great potential for taming the overwhelming numbers of arXiv papers, the limitiations of it being web-based, and written to work with linux, means that it does have its limits.

ASP-Win intends to be the next step for this - running locally in Windows with a GUI interface, with different modules being loaded as required (à la [QuDi](https://github.com/Ulm-IQO/qudi)).

### This is an evolution of the original arXiv Santiy Preserver
Give them love, I'm just standing on their shoulders!
